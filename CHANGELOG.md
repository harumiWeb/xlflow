# Changelog

All notable changes to xlflow will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Added UserForm Phase 1 warnings and hints across `pull`, `push`, `save`, `session`, and file-based `inspect` so xlflow now makes `.frm` / `.frx` fidelity limits, live-vs-disk state, and planned deeper form workflows explicit before dedicated form commands run.
- Added UserForm Phase 2 discovery with `xlflow list forms`, including session-aware workbook reuse, keepalive support, VBIDE-backed form enumeration, and expected `.frm` / `.frx` source-path reporting without loading forms at runtime.
- Added UserForm Phase 3 inspection with `xlflow inspect form`, including `--runtime`, `--designer`, `--both`, optional `--initializer`, structured form/control snapshots, and temp-copy runtime execution so form initialization can be inspected without mutating the source workbook or attached live session.
- Added UserForm Phase 4 persistence with `xlflow form snapshot`, including strict Designer-backed JSON/YAML export, temp-copy helper execution for concrete control types, session-aware targeting, and structured `forms` / `output` result metadata.
- Added UserForm Phase 5 visual export with `xlflow form export-image`, including runtime PNG capture from a temporary workbook copy, optional `--initializer`, structured `target` / `forms` / `output` metadata, and experimental Windows desktop Excel GUI capture warnings.
- Hardened `form export-image` runtime capture so VBA compile/runtime dialogs are trapped through the Excel dialog watcher, caption-changing forms can still be resolved by saved window handle/caption, and capture-prepare failures are classified as validation failures instead of generic environment errors.
- Updated the CLI contract, READMEs, bundled xlflow skill guidance, and internal feature specs to document the new UserForm warning, discovery, inspection, snapshot, and image-export workflows.

## v0.7.0

- Added `xlflow edit cell`, `edit range`, `edit rows`, and `edit columns` as minimal workbook-mutation helpers for AI-agent testing and visual tuning in a live Excel session.
- Added session-only workbook edit behavior for the new `edit` commands, including `--events keep|on|off` support for cell value and formula changes so `Worksheet_Change` flows can be exercised without generating temporary VBA.
- Commands now display explicit workbook state, including whether reading from saved file or live Excel session
- Added warnings when live session workbooks contain unsaved changes
- Extended workbook-backed JSON and human output with explicit `target` / `session` metadata across session-aware commands, plus top-level `edit` payloads for workbook mutation summaries.
- Updated the CLI contract, README files, ADR session policy note, and bundled xlflow skill guidance to cover the new edit workflow and session-state visibility.

## v0.6.0

- Added `xlflow export-image` to export worksheet ranges as PNG images for visual verification, including session-aware targeting, structured `target` / `output` metadata, and reliability fixes so hidden-workbook captures do not produce blank images or leak Excel processes.
- Added `--include-style` flag to `inspect range` and `inspect used-range` commands to display worksheet style metadata including cell fills, borders, merged cells, row heights, and column widths.
- Added Rubberduck-compatible folder-aware VBA sync so `xlflow pull` and `push` can round-trip nested source trees via `@Folder(...)`, recursive source discovery, duplicate module-name preflight, and nested `.frm`/`.frx` companion handling.
- Added `[vba]` configuration defaults for folder sync control, wired the settings through the Go/PowerShell bridge, and documented the new contract in the CLI spec, READMEs, and bundled xlflow skill.
- Fixed folder-sync path handling to stay compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1 and hardened `pull` so it does not clear the existing exported source tree before the workbook opens successfully.
- Added `--no-update-check` and `XLFLOW_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` so interactive `new` and `init` can skip the GitHub Release lookup used by the scaffold welcome banner.
- Hardened GitHub Release packaging with stable `checksums.txt` SHA256 output and archive SBOM generation via GoReleaser.
- Extended the release workflow to install Syft and publish GitHub artifact attestations for release archives, checksums, and SBOM artifacts.
- Documented Windows-side release verification in both READMEs, including SHA256 checks, `gh attestation verify`, and the current non-goal of Authenticode signing.

## v0.5.0

- Added richer sample VBA projects, including the `world-news` NewsAPI example and the `stock-price` dashboard example, plus accompanying screenshots and README updates.
- Improved runtime error handling and diagnostics so CLI runs surface failures more clearly across the Go and PowerShell execution bridge.
- Refined release documentation and sample project metadata with formatting fixes and README polish, including Japanese README badge updates.

## v0.4.0

- Added `xlflow inspect` with workbook, sheet, range, used-range, and cell inspection for saved workbook snapshots.
- Added inspect-specific formatting and range limits so agents can read workbook structure and output without opening Excel.
- Updated the bundled xlflow agent skill and CLI contract docs to teach snapshot-first inspect workflows.

## v0.3.0

- Added automatic reuse of a matching live xlflow session workbook for workbook-backed commands when `--session` is omitted.
- Added structured save-state reporting so `push`, `run`, `session status`, and related commands can surface when a live session workbook differs from disk and needs `xlflow save`.
- Improved `run` with compile-first diagnostic mode, clearer direct-run restrictions, and fallback to `project.entry` when no macro argument is provided.
- Expanded trace lifecycle handling with enable/disable/status/clean flows, temporary trace injection, and session-aware workbook reuse.
- Added a verbose `version` command that reports build metadata, script resolution, supported features, and executable details.
- Added update-checking and refreshed version/welcome messaging.
- Updated bundled PowerShell scripts, agent skill guidance, and JSON envelopes to match the new session-aware behavior.

## v0.2.0

- Bundled the PowerShell scripts used by xlflow for Excel session management, testing, tracing, and UI button manipulation.
- Added the initial session-aware command surface for opening, reusing, saving, and stopping Excel workbooks.
- Added trace, run, pull, push, test, and UI button workflows built on the bundled PowerShell bridge.
