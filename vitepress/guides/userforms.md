# Manage UserForms

Use `form snapshot` to capture Designer state, `form build` to create from a persisted specification, and `form export-image` to verify the rendered result. In sidecar mode, Designer structure lives in `src/forms/specs/` and code-behind in `src/forms/code/`.

```bash
xlflow form snapshot UserForm1 --json
xlflow form build src/forms/specs/UserForm1.yaml --json
xlflow form export-image UserForm1 --json
```

Run `lint` and `form build` preflight before opening Excel. Do not edit generated `.frm` code-behind independently when sidecar mode is authoritative; see the [UserForm specification](../reference/userform-spec).
