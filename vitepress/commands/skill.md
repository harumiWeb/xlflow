# xlflow skill

Install the bundled xlflow skill for AI agent tools.

## Usage

```bash
xlflow skill install [--agent <provider>|--target <dir>] [--force]
```

## When to use

Use this command when its target state is the next step in the source-to-workbook workflow. Prefer `--json` for automation and AI agents.

## Example

```bash
xlflow skill install --agent codex
```

## Output notes

JSON output uses the xlflow envelope with `status`, `command`, `error`, and command-specific top-level fields. Workbook-backed commands may also include `target`, `session`, `warnings`, and `hints`.
