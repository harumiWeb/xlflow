# xlflow inspect

Inspect saved workbook state or UserForm state.

## Usage

```bash
xlflow inspect workbook|sheets|range|used-range|cell|form ...
```

## When to use

Use this command when its target state is the next step in the source-to-workbook workflow. Prefer `--json` for automation and AI agents.

## Example

```bash
xlflow inspect range --sheet Result --address A1:F20 --include-style --json
```

## Output notes

JSON output uses the xlflow envelope with `status`, `command`, `error`, and command-specific top-level fields. Workbook-backed commands may also include `target`, `session`, `warnings`, and `hints`.

## Common failures

- CLI or config mistakes return exit code `2`.
- Validation, lint, macro, GUI-boundary, or test failures return exit code `1`.
- Excel, COM, VBIDE, PowerShell, or bridge failures return exit code `3`.
